# Block Subs

Block Subs is a cross-browser extension for blocking hard coded subtitles within any video in any website you can imagine.
Why would this be useful? In the context of immersion-based language learning, learners often encounter
content in their target language, although this comes with a catch: embedded subtitles in their native language.

It can be distracting and understandably difficult to avoid looking at them, but since it takes away from our learning,
we need a proper solution to deal with this.

An old fashioned approach would be to cover it up physically with a piece of tape, but this is clearly too clunky of
a solution. This was precisely the reason I created this extension. It places a bar, with a color of your choice,
around where the subtitles would normally appear.
